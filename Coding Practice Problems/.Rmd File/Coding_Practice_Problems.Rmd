# 1 - ATM

Pooja would like to withdraw X USD from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.

* Input: Positive integer 0 < X <= 2000 - the amount of cash which Pooja wishes to withdraw. Nonnegative number 0<= Y <= 2000 with two digits of precision - Pooja's initial account balance. 

* Output: Output the account balance after the attempted transaction, given as a number with two digits of precision. If there is not enough money in the account to complete the transaction, output the current bank balance.
```{r}
atm <- function(x, y){
  if(x %% 5 == 0){
    withdrawal <- y - x
    final <- round(withdrawal - 0.50, 2)
  } else {
    stop("x must be a multiple of 5")
  }
  if (x > y){
    stop(paste("Insufficient funds for withdrawal. You only have", y, "but you requested", x))
  }
  balance <- paste("Your remaining balance is:", y - final)
  return(list("Withdrawal Amount" = final, "Balance" = balance))
}

atm(x = 100, y = 120)
```

# 2 - Add Two Numbers

Shivam is the youngest programmer in the world, he is just 12 years old. Shivam is learning programming and today he is writing his first program.

The task is very simple: given two integers A and B, write a program to add these two numbers and output it.

* Input: The first line contains an integer T, the total number of test cases. Then follow T lines, each line contains two Integers A and B.

* Output: For each test case, add A and B and display the sum in a new line.

* Constraints: 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ A,B ≤ 10000
```{r}
addnums <- function(len_t, a, b){
  stopifnot(len_t >= 1, len_t <= 1000, a >= 0, b >= 0, a <= 10000, b <= 10000)
  stor <- list()[1:len_t]
  for(i in 1:len_t){
    stor[[i]] <- a[i] + b[i]
  }
  return(stor)
}

addnums(len_t = 3, a = c(1,2,3), b = c(1,2,3))
```

# 3 - Number Mirror

Write a program that accepts a number, n, and outputs the same.

* Input: The only line contains a single integer.

* Output: Output the answer in a single line.

* Constraints: 0 ≤ n ≤ 105
```{r}
mirror <- function(n){
  stopifnot(length(n) == 1)
  if(n <= 0 | n >= 10^5){
    stop("n is not within the constraints") 
  }  else {
    print(n)
  }
}

mirror(n = 1)
```

# 4 - Sum of Digits

You're given an integer N. Write a program to calculate the sum of all the digits of N.

* Input: The first line contains an integer T, the total number of testcases. Then follow T lines, each line contains an integer N.

* Output: For each test case, calculate the sum of digits of N, and display it in a new line.

* Constraints: 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000

Here we are using: `sum(as.numeric(strsplit(x = as.character(n), split = "")[[1]]))`. This code will:

* First, it will coerce the number vector into a character vector.
* Then, it will split the character vector into separate parts. This will turn it into a list. 
* Then, it will subset the list using the first index, which will give us the numbers as splits characters.
* Finally, the numbers will be coerced into a numeric type and summed. 
```{r}
sumdigits <- function(len_t, n){
  stopifnot(len_t > 0, len_t < 1000, n > 0, n < 1000000)
  x <- lapply(X = n, FUN = function(x) sum(as.numeric(strsplit(x = as.character(n), split = "")[[1]])))
  print(x)
}

sumdigits(len_t = 3, n = c(123,123,123))

#using for loop instead of lapply()
sumdigits_for <- function(len_t, n){
  stopifnot(len_t >= 1, len_t <= 1000, n >= 1, n <= 1000000)
  stor <- list()[1:len_t]
  for(i in 1:len_t){ 
    stor[[i]] <- sum(as.numeric(strsplit(x = as.character(n[i]), split = "")[[1]]))
  }
  return(stor)
}

sumdigits_for(len_t = 3, n = c(123,123,123))
```

# 5 - Find Remainder

Write a program to find the remainder when an integer A is divided by an integer B.

* Input: The first line contains an integer T, the total number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each line contains two Integers A and B.

* Output: For each test case, find the remainder when A is divided by B, and display it in a new line.

* Constraints: 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ A,B ≤ 10000
```{r}
remainder <- function(len_t, a, b){
  stopifnot(len_t >= 1, len_t <= 1000, a >= 0, b >= 0, a <= 10000, b <= 10000)
  stor <- list(1:len_t)
  for(i in 1:len_t){
    stor[[i]] <- a[i] %% b[i]
  }
  return(stor)
}

remainder(len_t = 3, a = c(10,5,3), b = c(6,4,2))
```

# 6 - First and Last Digit 

If Give an integer N . Write a program to obtain the sum of the first and last digits of this number.

* Input: The first line contains an integer T, the total number of test cases. Then follow T lines, each line contains an integer N.

* Output: For each test case, display the sum of first and last digits of N in a new line.

* Constraints: 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000
```{r}
firlasdig <- function(len_t, n){
  stopifnot(len_t >= 1, len_t <= 1000, n >= 1, n <= 1000000)
  stor <- list()[1:len_t]
  for(i in 1:len_t){
    split <- as.numeric(strsplit(x = as.character(n[i]), split = "")[[1]])
    stor[[i]] <- (split[1] + split[length(split)])
  }
  return(stor)
}

firlasdig(len_t = 3, n = c(123, 123, 123))
```

Instead of `x[length(x)]`, we can also do:

* `tail(x, n=1)`
* `x[end(x)][1]`
* `rev(x)[1]`

  }
  return(stor)
}

luckyfour(len_t = 4, n = c(1234, 445566, 7444, 555))
```

```

# 16 - Packaging Cupcakes

Now that Chef has finished baking and frosting his cupcakes, it's time to package them. Chef has N cupcakes, and needs to decide how many cupcakes to place in each package. Each package must contain the same number of cupcakes. Chef will choose an integer A between 1 and N, inclusive, and place exactly A cupcakes into each package. Chef makes as many packages as possible. Chef then gets to eat the remaining cupcakes. Chef enjoys eating cupcakes very much. Help Chef choose the package size A that will let him eat as many cupcakes as possible.

* Input: Input begins with an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single integer N, the number of cupcakes.

* Output: For each test case, output the package size that will maximize the number of leftover cupcakes. If multiple package sizes will result in the same number of leftover cupcakes, print the largest such size.

```

# 18 - Chef and Remissness 

The office where the Chef works, has two guards who count how many times a person enters into the office building. Though the duty of a guard is 24 hours in a day, sometimes they fall asleep during their duty and do not track the entry of a person in the office building. But one good thing is that they never fall asleep at the same time. At least one of them remains awake and counts who enters into the office.


Now the boss of Chef wants to calculate how many times the Chef has entered into the building. The boss asked to the guard and they gave him two integers A and B, the count of first guard and second guard respectively.


Help the boss to count the minimum and maximum number of times Chef could have entered into the office building.

* Input: The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of the T test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a line containing two space separated integers A and B.

  } else {
    print(n - 1)
  }
}

decorin(n = 5)
```

# 20 - Mahasena 

Kattapa, as you all know was one of the greatest warriors of his time. The kingdom of Maahishmati had never lost a battle under him (as army-chief), and the reason for that was their really powerful army, also called as Mahasena.

Kattapa was known to be a very superstitious person. He believed that a soldier is "lucky" if the soldier is holding an even number of weapons, and "unlucky" otherwise. He considered the army as "READY FOR BATTLE" if the count of "lucky" soldiers is strictly greater than the count of "unlucky" soldiers, and "NOT READY" otherwise.

Given the number of weapons each soldier is holding, your task is to determine whether the army formed by all these soldiers is "READY FOR BATTLE" or "NOT READY".

* Input: The first line of input consists of a single integer N denoting the number of soldiers. The second line of input consists of N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, where Ai denotes the number of weapons that the ith soldier is holding

* Output: Generate one line output saying "READY FOR BATTLE", if the army satisfies the conditions that Kattapa requires or "NOT READY" otherwise (quotes for clarity)

* Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 100
```{r}
battle <- function(n = a, a){
  stopifnot(n >= 1, n <= 100, a >= 1, a <= 100)
  if(sum(a %% 2 == 0) > sum(a %% 2 != 0)){
    print("READY FOR BATTLE")
  } else {
    print("NOT READY")
  }
}

battle(a = c(11:14))
```

# 21 - Sum or Difference

* Input: First line will contain the first number (N1), Second line will contain the second number (N2)

* Output: Output a single line containing the difference of 2 numbers (N1−N2) if the first number is greater than the second number otherwise output their sum (N1+N2).

* Constraints: −1000 ≤ N1 ≤ 1000, −1000 ≤ N2 ≤ 1000
```{r}
sumdiff <- function(n1, n2){

  x <- numeric()
  for(i in 1:length(n)){ #first for loop to run the same number of times as length n 
  n[i] <- n[i] #this will make a vector containing the n values
  x[i] <- 0 #this will make a vector containing 0s and the same length as the vector of n values - it will end up holding how many notes go into a particular number 
  for(j in 1:length(den)){ #now we will make a for loop to iterate over the den vector - will iterate 6 times
  x[i] <- x[i] + (n[i] %/% den[j]) #how many times the denomination goes into n - so, if 100 goes into 242 2 times, it will store this in the x vector 
  n[i] <- n[i] %% den[j] #the remainder of n after removing the previous denomination - so, if 100 goes into 242 2 times, that is 242 - 100, so 42 will be the new n
}
  }
  return(x)
}

snn(len_t = 3, n = c(1200, 500, 242))

# 23 - The Block Game

The citizens of Byteland regularly play a game. They have blocks each denoting some integer from 0 to 9. These are arranged together in a random manner without seeing to form different numbers keeping in mind that the first block is never a 0. Once they form a number they read in the reverse order to check if the number and its reverse is the same. If both are same then the player wins. We call such numbers palindrome.

Ash happens to see this game and wants to simulate the same in the computer. As the first step he wants to take an input from the user and check if the number is a palindrome and declare if the user wins or not.

* Input: The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines containing an integer N.

* Output: For each input output "wins" if the number is a palindrome and "loses" if not, in a new line.

* Constraints: 1<=T<=20, 1<=N<=20000
```{r}
palindrome <- function(len_t, n){
  stopifnot(len_t >= 1, len_t <= 20, n >= 1, n <= 20000)
  stor <- list()
  for(i in 1:len_t){
    if(identical(as.character(n[i]), paste(rev(strsplit(as.character(n[i]), "")[[1]]), collapse= ""))){
      stor[[i]] <- "wins"
    } else{
      stor[[i]] <- "loses"

  }
    return(stor)
}

palindrome(len_t = 3, n = c(331, 666, 343))

# 24 - Primality Test

Alice and Bob are meeting after a long time. As usual they love to play some math games. This times Alice takes the call and decides the game. The game is very simple, Alice says out an integer and Bob has to say whether the number is prime or not. Bob as usual knows the logic but since Alice doesn't give Bob much time to think, so Bob decides to write a computer program.

Help Bob accomplish this task by writing a computer program which will calculate whether the number is prime or not .

* Input: The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow. Each of the next T lines contains an integer N which has to be tested for primality. 

* Output: For each test case output in a separate line, "yes" if the number is prime else "no."

* Constraints: 1 ≤ T ≤ 20, 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000

# 25 - Puppy and Sum

Yesterday, puppy Tuzik learned a magically efficient method to find the sum of the integers from 1 to N. He denotes it as sum(N). But today, as a true explorer, he defined his own new function: sum(D, N), which means the operation sum applied D times: the first time to N, and each subsequent time to the result of the previous operation.

For example, if D = 2 and N = 3, then sum(2, 3) equals to sum(sum(3)) = sum(1 + 2 + 3) = sum(6) = 21.

Tuzik wants to calculate some values of the sum(D, N) function. Will you help him with that?

Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is, therefore, planning something particularly nefarious. Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier — a machine which mutates minions

Each minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer. The transmogrifier adds an integer K to each of the minions' characteristic value.

Given the initial characteristic integers of N minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.

* Input: The first line contains one integer, T, which is the number of test cases. Each test case is then described in two lines. The first line contains two integers N and K, as described in the statement. The next line contains N integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions.

* Output: For each test case, output one integer in a new line, which is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification.
