# Introduction

Hello! My name is Kevin Patyk and I am currently a graduate student at Utrecht University studying Methodology and Statistics at the faculty of Social Sciences. I am set to graduate in June 2022. 

Some of my interests include:

* Data Science
* Machine Learning
* Missing Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Applied Statistics

# Contents

Each folder contains an `.Rmd` file and a corresponding `R Markdown` HTML file. If there are any images or data associated with the code, they will be in the `Data` and `Images` folders. 

# Independent Projects Repository

This is a repository for my independent projects, i.e. tasks I have completed or am working on outside of work or school and just based of off personal interest.

Some things in this repository include:

* Coding algorithms from scratch either individually or by following guides 
* Coding functional programming practice problems from CodeChef  
* Individual data science projects 
* Coding exercises to bolster my skills, especially in practices I do not frequently use
* Creating explanations for algorithms and/or coding for myself and to share with others

If any of these files are of any interest to you or you feel may help, do not hestitate to fork the repository. Thank you and have a nice day!
